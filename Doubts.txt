My website is hosted in firebase - link is provided here - https://cogoport-webpage.web.app

Difficulties i faced during the website development is;

1) Video embedding in the website (video of cogoport training on a pause button click)
2) whatsapp input bar in the first section
3) extracting data from the website (like products, partners data in the footer)
4) changing nav bar color when scrolled.
5) whatsapp button is coming after scrolling the homepage which i am not able to acheive.
6) Unable to place arrow images in the How it works section.

I used react but most of the code is plain html and css only, as you mentioned to do that.
